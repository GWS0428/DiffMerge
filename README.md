This paper defines **semantic binding** as the task of associating an object with its attribute (attribute binding) or linking it to related sub-objects (object binding). We propose a novel method called **Token Merging (ToMe)**, which enhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a single composite token, aligning the object, its attributes, and sub-objects in the same cross-attention map.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Environment Setup**

   **Create and activate the Conda virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate tome
   ```
   Alternatively, install dependencies via `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   Additionally, download the SpaCy model for syntax parsing:

   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
   ```

2. **Configure Parameters**

   Modify the `configs/demo_config.py` file to adjust runtime parameters as needed. This file includes two example configuration classes: `RunConfig1` for object binding and `RunConfig2` for attribute binding. Key parameters are as follows:

   - `prompt`: Text prompt for guiding image generation.
   - `model_path`: Path to the Stable Diffusion model; set to `None` to download the pretrained model automatically.
   - `use_nlp`: Whether to use an NLP model for token parsing.
   - `token_indices`: Indices of tokens to merge.
   - `prompt_anchor`: Split text prompt.
   - `prompt_merged`: Text prompt after token merging.
   - For further parameter details, please refer to the comments in the configuration file and our paper.

3. **Run the Example**

   Execute the main script `run_demo.py`:

   ```bash
   python run_demo.py
   ```

   The generated images will be saved in the `demo` directory.

## üì∏ Example Outputs

If everything is set up correctly, `RunConfig1` and `RunConfig2` should produce the left and right images below, respectively:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Custom Configurations**: To use custom text prompts and parameters, add a new configuration class in `configs/demo_config.py` and make necessary adjustments in `run_demo.py`.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: This method inherits the sensitivity of inference-based optimization techniques, meaning that the generated results are highly dependent on hyperparameter settings. Careful tuning may be required to achieve optimal results.
- **NLP Models**: When using NLP models like SpaCy for token parsing, ensure the correct language model is installed.
